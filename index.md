### CPSC 120 Favorite Labs!

* Lab 6, part 2 was one of my favorites because Black Jack is a game of probability. Creating a function for Black Jack really put into perspective the use of if statements as well as else ifs when it comes to probability. This lab was a good way to really understand how Black Jack works and gives you a little bit of an edge when it comes to playing.


* Lab 7 part 1 was one of my favorites as well for its use of if statements. With trying to figure out what Street is closed at what time or day, it really makes you think about what you write down. This was a lab where you really had to have patience and trail and error to get it correctly.


* Lab 8 part 2 is my 3rd favorite for showing the variety of things you can do with coding. It showed that with the use of for loops you can make pictures with your functions. This lab sparked creativity outside of the normal of creating functions looking for an outcome of words.
